pyFabScan
=========

A python alternative to the official FabScan interface

This project is going to become a solid alternative to the official FabScan software that will be programmed
in python.

Purpose
=======

pyFabScan is intended to become entirely platform-independent, so it can run on either Linux, Windows or Mac OSX and
even on the Raspberry Pi platform.

Progress
========

The development of pyFabScan has just started, though I have already written a class for accessing the arduino.
Basically, turning on/off the stepper or the laser and moving the stepper by a command line interface is possible,
the first step of the development process is done.
